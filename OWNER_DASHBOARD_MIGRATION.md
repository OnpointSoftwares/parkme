# Owner Dashboard Migration Guide

## 🎉 What's New

The owner dashboard has been completely refactored into a **production-ready, modular architecture** with improved maintainability, security, and user experience.

## 📦 New Structure

```
lib/owner/
├── models/
│   └── parking_spot_model.dart          # Clean data model with factory methods
├── services/
│   └── parking_spot_service.dart        # All Firebase operations & business logic
├── screens/
│   ├── my_parking_spots_screen.dart     # Parking spots management
│   ├── my_bookings_screen.dart          # Bookings management
│   └── add_edit_parking_spot_screen.dart # Form for add/edit operations
├── widgets/
│   ├── parking_spot_card.dart           # Reusable parking spot card
│   ├── booking_card.dart                # Reusable booking card
│   ├── statistics_card.dart             # Statistics display
│   └── location_picker_widget.dart      # Enhanced map picker
├── owner_dashboard_main.dart            # Main entry point
├── owner_dashboard.dart                 # DEPRECATED (backward compatible)
└── README.md                            # Complete documentation
```

## 🔄 Migration Steps

### Step 1: Update Imports

**Old:**
```dart
import 'package:parkme/owner/owner_dashboard.dart';

// Usage
Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(
  builder: (context) => OwnerDashboardPage()
));
```

**New:**
```dart
import 'package:parkme/owner/owner_dashboard_main.dart';

// Usage
Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(
  builder: (context) => const OwnerDashboard()
));
```

### Step 2: Update Dependencies

Ensure your `pubspec.yaml` includes:
```yaml
dependencies:
  firebase_core: ^2.24.0
  firebase_auth: ^4.15.0
  firebase_database: ^10.4.0
  google_maps_flutter: ^2.5.0
  geocoding: ^2.1.1
  geolocator: ^10.1.0
  intl: ^0.18.1
```

### Step 3: Test Functionality

Run through this checklist:
- [ ] Login as parking owner
- [ ] Navigate to owner dashboard
- [ ] Add a new parking spot
- [ ] Pick location on map
- [ ] Edit existing spot
- [ ] Toggle active/inactive status
- [ ] View statistics
- [ ] Check bookings
- [ ] Filter bookings
- [ ] Delete a spot
- [ ] Logout and login again

## 🆕 New Features Available

### Statistics Dashboard
```dart
// Automatically calculated:
- Total parking spots
- Active spots count
- Total capacity
- Current occupancy
- Occupancy rate percentage
```

### Enhanced Location Picker
- Drag-and-drop marker
- Use current location button
- Real-time address geocoding
- Fallback to coordinates if needed

### Booking Filters
- View all bookings
- Filter by today's bookings
- View upcoming bookings
- See completed bookings

### Detailed Views
- Tap any spot to see full details
- Tap any booking for complete information
- Bottom sheet modals for better UX

## 🔧 Configuration

### Firebase Security Rules

Update your Firebase Realtime Database rules:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "parkingCentres": {
      "$spotId": {
        ".read": true,
        ".write": "auth != null && (!data.exists() || data.child('ownerId').val() === auth.uid)",
        ".validate": "newData.hasChildren(['name', 'address', 'city', 'totalSpots', 'costPerHour', 'ownerId', 'position'])"
      }
    },
    "reservations": {
      ".read": "auth != null",
      ".write": "auth != null"
    }
  }
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot find OwnerDashboard"
**Solution**: Make sure you're importing from `owner_dashboard_main.dart`

### Issue: Map not showing
**Solution**: Ensure Google Maps API key is configured in Android/iOS

### Issue: Location permission denied
**Solution**: Check app permissions in device settings

### Issue: Data not saving
**Solution**: Verify Firebase configuration and authentication

## 📚 Documentation

- See `lib/owner/README.md` for complete API documentation
- Check individual files for inline documentation
- Review widget examples in the README

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Always validate user input** before saving
2. **Show loading states** during async operations
3. **Provide clear feedback** on success/error
4. **Handle errors gracefully** with user-friendly messages
5. **Test on real devices** for location features

## 🚀 Performance Tips

- Use `StreamBuilder` for real-time data (parking spots)
- Use `FutureBuilder` for one-time fetches (bookings, statistics)
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Optimize map rendering

## 📞 Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the README.md in `lib/owner/`
2. Review code comments and documentation
3. Test with the provided checklist
4. Check Firebase console for data structure

## ✅ Backward Compatibility

The old `OwnerDashboardPage` class is still available but deprecated. It automatically redirects to the new `OwnerDashboard`. This ensures existing code continues to work while you migrate.

**Note**: The deprecated class will be removed in a future version. Please migrate as soon as possible.
